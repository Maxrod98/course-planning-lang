# course-planning-lang

Students are usually required to take courses that have prerequisites and corequisites. It is often hard to plan manually what would be the best way to take your classes while at the same time checking what are the prereqs for each class. That is why I propose building a programming language that is English-like that will facilitate the work of advisers and students to plan their courses through each semester to be able to graduate on time.

Programming language examples:

```

CSCE221 is PREREQ for CSCE431
CSCE315, CSCE221 are PREREQ for CSCE 431
CSCE315 has
  CSCE221 as COREQ
  CSCE121 as PREREQ
end


```
